phosh-osk-stub (0.43~rc1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * css: Drop superfluous semicolon
  * debug-widget: Drop ui. Fixes bdaf2f8ab ("debug-widget: Drop it")
  * presage: Always set predictors.
    This ensures we don't have unwanted predictors like the abbreviation
    predictor in there that currently doesn't work as intended as it adds
    unwanted tab characters.
  * packaging: No need to link abbreviations. We're not using them anymore
  * build: Drop icon theme update. We don't install icons
  * dbus: Update OSK0 protocol from phosh. Let's use the canonical version
  * build: Install completer descriptions.
    We only install descriptions of completers found at build time.
  * packaging: Install completer data
  * doc: Document swipeGuess use
  * ci: Update shared scripts to 5e3667e
  * ci: Use common style check
  * ci: Update ci-fairy check
  * ci: Use update image.
    Update to Debian Trixie as of 2024-10-21
  * shortcuts-bar: Use correct return type. We return a pointer so use `NULL`.
  * input-surface: Drop unused clipboard-copy
  * shortcuts-bar: Allow to add `<ctrl>` and `<alt>`
    They're tracked as toggle buttons that latch until the next character
    is entered.
  * vk-driver: Helper to convert bitween modifier flags. We want to
    convert from Gdk to our internal ones.
  * input-surface: Track latched modifiers.
    Currently then can only come form the shortcuts bar (thus affect the
    terminal layout).
  * schema: Add alt and ctrl to shortcuts bar
  * doc: Document latched modifiers in the shortcuts bar
  * css: Use current adwait's background color.
    Makes the OSK look more integrated
  * treewide: Move resources to mobi.phosh
  * build: Depend on recent schema. Needed for accent colors
  * style-manager: Add class from phosh. Copy from phosh's
      64035d6f5 ("Merge branch 'for-upstream/phosh/accent-colours' into 'main'")
  * style-manager: Adjust gresource path and prefix
  * css: Override GTK defaults for menu buttons.
    This gives us proper styling with accent colors
  * input-method: Use style manager.
    This gives us accent color support and frees PosInputSurface
    from style handling.
  * emoji-picker: Place section at the right edge in RTL locales.
    Helps: https://gitlab.gnome.org/guidog/phosh-osk-stub/-/issues/44
  * emoji-picker: Select correct section in RTL locales.
    When scrolling in RTL locales we bring in the new section from the
    right. Take that into account when highlighting the currently active
    section.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/guidog/phosh-osk-stub/-/issues/44
  * osk-widget: Move key press logic to separate function.
    We'll use that for touch event handling
  * osk-widget: Make key_release_action symmetric to key_press_action
    key_press_actions sets `self->current` so `self->current` should
    be unset in `key_release_action`.
  * osk-widget: Handle touch events.
    This allows us to process overlapping key presses by looking at the
    individual touch events rather than handling them as button presses.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/guidog/phosh-osk-stub/-/issues/41
  * input-surface: Don't submit empty preedit.
    This needlessly clears selected text and is similar
    to https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/phoc/-/merge_requests/592
    Fixes f8edcb646 ("input-surface: Submit preedit on layout changes to emoji or terminal")

    to reduce unnecessary layout-changes,
    when switching the view with the Shift-button.
    The `,`-button is already there in the lower-case-view.
  * layouts/terminal: Move `/` to the popover of the `,`-button
    where `|` is available, so that similar symbols are in the same popover.

phosh-osk-stub (0.42.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * layout-info: Ensure stable sorting.
    This makes sure we stay reproducible
  * input-surface: Better check for completion mode.
    When the IM signals surrounding text changes we want to perform the same
    checks as on preedit changes (`on_completer_preedit_changed`) or
    completion updates (`on_completer_update`). Otherwise we end up picking
    up preedit again due to:
    Long press for cursor mode
     -> on_osk_mode_changed()
       -> submit preedit via pos_input_surface_submit_current_preedit()
       … due to that commit we receive new surrounding text from the compositor
        -> pos_completer_presage_set_surrounding_text
          -> we update preedit again
    This fixes the long standing issue where entering cursor mode would
    double the preedit when using the presage completer (hunspell and others
    are not affected as they don't care about changed surrounding text).
  * presage: Don't try to grab last word.
    We only want that for "edit" mode (when deleting backwards into a word)
    but trigger it in many other situations triggering lost or duplicated
    text.
    This should allow us to use presage completion in a stable way rather
    than keeping it experimental forever.
  * input-surface: Submit preedit on layout changes to emoji or terminal.
    Otherwise funky things happen
  * data: Validate schemas
  * data: Enable opportunistic completion by default.
    With the recent compositor and OSK fixes it should be stable enough to
    at least enable in those cases where the application recommends to use
    completion (e.g. gnome-text-editor or chatty).

    This avoids flicker when the OSK folds
  * build: Ack libfeedback's unstable API just once.
    No need to do it in multiple places
  * completer: Add vfunc to learn accepted words.
    Implementation by completers is optional
  * varnam: Learn accepted words.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/guidog/phosh-osk-stub/-/issues/26
  * build: Install layout information.
    This allows other tools to figure out which layouts
    we support.
  * logind-session: Clear manager location.
    Otherwise we trigger a use after free if the manager gets
    unref'ed and we want a new one.
  * input-surface: Drop explicit-notify from construct-only properties.
    It makes no sense as they're only set once so we can let glib
    handle it.
  * completer-manager: Fix outdated doc string.
    We never added `set_from_info`
  * build: Make doc warnings fatal.
    Make sure we spot broken links early
  * build: Add gmobile dependency
  * treewide: Bump glib dependency to 2.80.
    Fix the deprecations. We can just remove the function triggering the
    deprecation warning from phosh's utils as it's unused.
  * vk-driver: Allow to pass additional modifiers.
    This allows us to submit complex key combos for virtual keyboards
  * vk-driver: Drop now unused copy/paste symbols
  * clipboard-manager: New object to handle clipboard interaction.
    We use wlr-data-control-v1 to track the clipboard contents and store any
    text offers we see.
  * input-surface: Use clipboard manager.
    This allows us to paste text via a paste button
  * completion-bar: Add paste button

    build warning
  * build: Don't pass file() element to str.format()
    Silences a build warning
  * build: Add explicit gdk{-wayland} dependencies.
    Instead of relying that `gtk3.0.pc` will do the right thing add an
    explicit dependency as we use it's functions.
  * osk-stub: Short circuit checks when force-show is true.
    Short circuit all other visibility checks as otherwise e.g. a hardware
    keyboard breaks showing the OSK.
  * widget: Drop unused parameters in draw
  * osk-widget: Make number of rows dynamic.
    Don't hard code the maximum number of keyboard rows that can be parsed
    but rather set an upper limit. Adjust the common keys placement based on
    that.
  * osk-widget: Bottom align layouts
  * layouts: Add more layouts.
    Fixes: 187aea18a ("layouts: Add more layouts")
  * layouts/ir: Remove duplicate space (0x20) key.
    Both use the same ASCII code.
  * tools: Robustify layout screenshots.
    Rewrite in Python, exit on criticals.
  * ci: Screenshot layouts
  * layouts: Make layout names match xkb names.
    E.g. xkb is `gb`. Also add those to the resources.

phosh-osk-stub (0.38.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * osk-stub: Make protocol static.
    No need to have it visible in other compilation units
  * protocols: Add device-state.
    This will allow us to detect connected hw keyboards and disable the OSK.
  * README: Document new features
  * hw-tracker: Track connected keyboards and allow to prevent unfold.
    Usually when a hardware keyboard is attached one doesn't want to show
    the OSK as this takes up screen space.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/guidog/phosh-osk-stub/-/issues/37
  * hw-tracker: Add setting to ignore hw-keyboards.
    This helps in situations where people want an OSK and a hardware
    keyboard.
  * osk-stub: Revalidate whether to show the OSK when attached hw changed.
    This allows to show/hide the OSK immediately on hw changes (and not
    delay that decision until the next activation).
  * pos-input-surface: Delay initial key submission.
    Wait until phosh is hopefully up.
    Improves 353e39a86 ("input-surface: Make sure we have an input serial")
  * input-surface: Set a style class.
    This allows us to style the area outside of the osk widget
  * osk-widget: Use a osk specific background color in all variants
    @pos_bg_color was already used for the completion bar but undefined.
    This fixes unreadable completion bar text in high contrast mode and
    also gives us an easy way to change the default background color
    for the osk-widget and input-surface.
  * style: Introduce our own fg color.
    We can use that wherever @theme_fg_color would be used. For all

  * input-surface: Use our theme bg color.
    So far the surface defaulted to whatever the theme used. This allows

  * vk-driver: Try harder to get an event code.
    If it's not in the table use GDK's reverse mapping function.
    Closes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/guidog/phosh-osk-stub/-/issues/21
  * vk-driver: Minimize GDK mapping table.
    We keep the regular letters to not e.g. swap Z and Y when the German
    layout is active.

  [ Kai Lüke ]
  * layouts: Prefer capital eszett over double S as German capitalization.
    The ezsett character didn't have a capitalization in fonts for long
    time and thus double S was used instead. Since some years a proper
    unicode capitalization is available and can be used instead (see
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F#Development_of_a_capital_form).
    Prefer the new capital eszett but still offer the double S as second
    alternative.

  [ Undef ]
  * layouts/terminal: Add escape to capital layer.
    Not having this key means that every key in the middle row moves slightly
    right on pressing shift, leading to occasional typos on the terminal
    keyboard.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * manpage: Minor consistency tweak
  * osk-stub: Document all debug flags
  * osk-stub: Remove unused variable
  * osk-widget: Move actual key actions into separate functions
  * osk-widget: Add 'delete' key use.
    Adding more use-types will allow us to do less string parsing in the
    future and to specify the key-use in the layouts already. This will also
    be useful for more complex layout switchings e.g. for uim.
  * osk-widget: Limit key repeat to delete.
    It doesn't work for keys with popovers anyway, it's not needed for space
    as we move the cursor with that so backspace (and maybe <return>) remain
    the only sensible users.
  * osk-widget: Allow to drag fingers between keys.
    The default is to cancel the keypress when the finger leaves the area of
    one key and enters the area of another. Add a new mode that marks the
    old key as released and the new key as pressed instead.
    For that introduce features flags.
  * input-surface: Add common features for all layouts.
    There's some features we want to configure for all layouts.
    Allow to set them via a property on the input-surface and
    bind it to a gsetting.
  * metainfo: Switch to inputmethod.
    It's not a desktop application but rather a wayland input method
    and virtual keyboard.

phosh-osk-stub (0.27.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Update doap file.
    Fix some copy and paste errors when bringing that one in from
    phosh.
  * Add appstream metainfo
  * tools: Properly pick up default phoc.ini
  * tools: Use headless backend for screenshots.
    No need to bring up a window on the host and this way it's
    simpler in CI.
  * build: Detect available completers.
    The check for fzf is actually a runtime check but use it as this is
    solely for testing we assume built-time env == runtime env.
    We don't break any existing configurations since switching completers
    needed code changes anyway.
  * Add completer-manager.
    This class is responsible for mapping completion engines to keyboard
    layouts / locales.
    It keeps the input-surface clear from any knowledge about which
    completers are available.
    This introduces the minimal object which just returns the presage
    completer. The next commits will then add more completers.
  * input-surface: Hook up completer-manager.
    This already allows to switch the default completer via an environment
    variable.
  * completers/fzf: Drop commented out code
  * completers/fzf: Take an error location and use initable.
    This makes completers consistent. We use that as an opportunity to check
    if the word list is present.
  * completer-manager: Allow to select completer via POS_TEST_COMPLETER.
    This moves the default completer from compile time to program startup
    time.
  * Use a common dependency for all completers.
    This way we can keep the knowledge about available completers in
    completers/ (and PosCompleterManager).
  * shortcutsbar: Make css actually apply
  * css: Add section markers
  * doc: Fix POS_TEST_COMPLETER docs.
    The value descriptions ended up in the wrong place.
  * completers: Add unix pipe like completer.
    The completer gets the current preedit on stdin and can output a list of
    completions. We default to `cat` which just offers the current preedit
    as completion.
  * input-surface: Don't leak completions pos_completer_get_completions is
    "transfer: full"
  * completion-bar: Use a bold font for suggestions.  Makes them a bit more
    prominent
  * pipe: Only force kill command if still running
  * build: Move presage definitions to completers
  * completers: Make name a r/o property and set it
  * completer-manager: Allow to set default completer via GSetting.  Keep
    presage as the default.
  * osk-widget: Set language and region.  This corresponds the parts of a unix
    locale like <lang>_<region> although we use all lowercase.
  * completer: Split language and region.  This avoids leaking implementation
    details of the layouts into the completer.
  * input-surface: No need to switch language when switching to terminal
  * ci: Switch to image with libhunspell-dev
  * packaging: Enable hunspell completer.
    It's easier to set up than presage and pretty useful in en-us at least.
  * completers: Add simple hunspell completer.
  * Allow to use either hunspell or presage.
    We prefer hunspell atm. Later on we want presage and hunspell active
    at the same time.
  * doc: Update manpage.
    Document gsettings, mark completion in general as no longer
    experimental.

phosh-osk-stub (0.25.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * shortcuts-bar: Don't change background on hover
  * shortcuts-bar: Allow shortcuts to have different width.
    Ctrl+Shift+a takes considerably more space than e.g. Ctrl-a
    and as we want as many shortcuts in reach as possible allow
    for different sizes.
    Use slightly larger padding to make things not look too crammed.
  * shortcuts-bar: Make scrollbar consistent with emoji picker scrollbar
  * input-surface: Disable layout switching via swipe gesture by default.
    It's confusing to users and we have a popover now and copy/paste buttons
    can be added to the terminal shortcuts bar.
  * osk-stub: Allow to enable debug surface.
    We simply do this by allowing swipes.
  * doc: Link to GTK docs for valid accelerator values
  * news: Fix wording
  * input-surface: Set the terminal layout early.
    Just so we have layout setting closer together
  * input-surface: Mark Terminal display name as translatable
  * build: Drop config.h template.
    Extra effort to keep it in sync when adding
    new configuration data.
  * layouts/terminal: Make special shell characters easier to reach.
    The often needed ones should now be reachable via the first symbol level
    or a popover on the default level.
  * input-surface: Make sure we select the test layout.
    We want it visible right away.
  * Add helper to screenshot all language layouts.
    We screenshot at the 360x720, this can be changed by giving another
    phoc.ini
    Somewhat based on phosh's (long retired) smoketest:
  * packaging: Recommend fonts-noto-core.
    Otherwise we lack characters like the tab key
  * osk-key: Add expand property.
    This allows a key to take up extra horizontal space in a row.
  * osk-key: Allow to modify key width.
    So far it was construct-only but we want to fix it up later on.
  * osk-widget: Break overly long line
  * osk-widget: Allow space bar to take extra horizontal space.
    Instead of hardcoding a few values based on the number of keys rather
    expand to the maximum width.
    This avoids that the keys to switch layers jump around a lot based on
    the with of the space key. It's still not perfect in layouts that use
    11 keys in the `normal` layer but 10 keys in the `symbols` layer (e.g.
    Swedish).

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * build: Drop trailing character
  * packaging: Move desktop file to private dir.
    This avoids listing it twice e.g. in mobile-setting's feedback
    pane.
  * osk-widget: Use layer sensitive label on symbol-layer key.
    Use "123" when not on the symbols layer, otherwise "ABC". This
    will make it consistent to what we use in the emoji widget.
  * input-surface: Add helper to submit current preedit.
    This is needed in several places e.g. when switching modes.
  * Add emoji data.
    Taken from GTK as of commit
    1a4e368c7e5995b342db0be74f56c1eced74a0e6
  * Add emoji-picker.
    This is based on GTK's emoji picker. Besides
    smaller fixes and dropping unneeded bits:
    - switch to horizontal scrolling
    - wrap section in a scrolled window
    - add back and delete buttons
  * input-surface: Wire up emoji picker
  * input-surface: Submit preedit before inserting emoji.
    In completion mode we don't want to complete on emojies
    but rather submit the current text and append the emoji.
  * oskw-widget: Allow for empty rows.
    This avoids a crash in e.g. the arabic layout which lacks
  * osk-widget: Improve warning.
    Print out the "missing" layer name
  * Update Layer surface from phosh.
    This syncs up to
    811c55204d2be4f4714d66fe3863bdc8d7552bed
    to fix the potential problems like
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Phosh/squeekboard/-/issues/285
  * osk-widget: Add a hint that there's a popover.
    We display the first symbol in a slightly dimed color.
  * vk-driver: Unreak <alt> in shortcuts in the terminal's shortcut bar
  * input-surface: Don't try to adjust completion without an input method
  * input-surface: Switch widget and layer according to input purpose.
  * input-surface: Make sure to update language after setting completer.
    Otherwise we might be completing for the wrong language
  * manpage: Mention phosh manpage
  * build: Use summary()
  * main: Use g_init_once()
  * input-surface: Initialize resources.  This avoids lots of scary warnings
    when building the documentation.
  * README: Update screenshots
  * ci: Run tests in xvfb. We test widgets now
  * build: Allow to disable building the tests
  * tests: Use environment() to set test enviroment.
    A bit easier to read as we have key / value pairs.
  * layouts: Add more layouts.
    Again taken from gnome-shell as of
    The keyboard layouts were taken from gnome-shell as of
    6a88c0f0be5aed836f33ed2989d33add58c01403
  * osk-widget: Don't hardcode max layers in several locations.
    Get the array size from the enum.
  * osk-widget: Take layer name into account when parsing layers
    ara and il have only three layers and we want to match to the correct
    ones as otherwise we'll have symbols on the caps layer.
  * input-layer: Don't assume we have all layers.
    Otherwise we can't switch to symbols2.
  * osk-widget: Allow for empty layers on cleanup
    g_ptr_array_free() doesn't handle NULL well so guard against that.
  * osk-widget: Don't add a shift key if there's no caps layer.
    This is true in e.g. arabic and hebrew layouts.
  * tests: Load all layout into an osk-widget.
    This makes sure all osk-widgets can be instantiated.

phosh-osk-stub (0.23.0~rc2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * input-method: Use g_warning when we can't become the input method.
    This makes it easier to debug why the keyboard might not pop up.
  * d/control: Add breaks on older gtk3.
    We need a very recent version for completion to work due to Carlos fixes
    around 92813e52cde864139f3b740992e8c267a7a6bd1d.
  * input-surface: Adjust size based on size request.
    This makes us resize based on the presence of the completion bar
    and will later help resizing when we have fewer rows.
  * Add completer interface.
    Completers will implement this so we can have
    different completers.
  * Add completion bar widget.
    This holds the completions. We currently hardcode the minimal height.
  * input-surface: Allow to set completer.
    This allows to set a completer that gets fed via the input-method (when
    active). Possible completions are displayed above the osk widgets.
  * completers: Add presage based completer.
    It doesn't override the presage config atm so config e.g. language via
    ~/.presage/presage.xml
  * completers: Add a fzf based example completer.
    This completer uses `fzf` and the systems wordlist to complete the
    current preedit. The worldlist location is fixed. On Debian the default
    word list can be changed via
      select-default-wordlist
    The main purpose is to demo a simple completer.
  * osk-stub: Instantiate presage based completer
  * input-surface: Allow to turn completion on/off.
    We default to off and let the user turn it on when needed
    for the moment. This ensures we can easily recover in case
    of problems.
  * input-surface: Submit preedit on cursor moves.
    This allows e.g. for in word editing
  * completer: Add error quark.
    This allows to return more detailed errors.
  * completer-presage: Switch completion language.
    Switch language when OSK layout changes. We currently only use the
    "language" bits and don't use different corpi for e.g. de_DE, de_AT or
    de_CH. We'll change that once the first copi for situations like this
    show up.
  * osk-stub: Allow to force completion on.
    Helps for development
  * input-surface: Allow to toggle completion via menu.
    We do so by using a GPropertyAction that binds the `win.word-completion`
    action to the `completion-enabled` property.
    Since GPropertyAction holds a ref on the object (PosInputSurface) we
    need to connect to the `destroy` signal in order to break the reference
    cycle when calling `gtk_wiget_destroy` on PosInputSurface. Otherwise the
    input surface would never get disposed since the action_map holds a
    reference on the GPropertyAction which in turn holds a reference on the
    input surface.
    Since we don't want to have `destroy` and `dispose` we move the cleanup
    of the hash map there too.
    With GTK4 we can move to `gtk_widget_class_install_property_action` to
    get rid of this.
  * build: Use separate path for completion data.
    This will allow to share it more easily between OSKs
    without tripping up other completers.
  * d/control: Recommend phosh-osk-data-eu.
    Since we have the presage completer enabled (not the fzf one) recommend
    data usefull for that.
  * README: Document completion requirements
  * input-method: Reset hint on activate.
    Needs to happen according to protocol. This fixes the problem where
    opportunistic completion stays active when switching apps although.
  * build: Add run script.
    This keeps it simple to run phosh-osk-stub, even when the schema
    isn't installed.
  * Add enums and schema for completion mode
  * input-surface: Opportunistically enable compltion.
    When the input-method hints us to enable completion do so, otherwise
    turn it off but respect the users prefs.
  * debian: Install schema files
  * input-surface: Disable completion button when compltion mode is 'none'
  * README: Document gsetting and feature
  * README: Update how to start osk-stub.
    As we have custom schema now we wrap it in the run script as
    otherwise osk-stub won't start.
  * build: Use gnome.post_install()
    Makes it a bit nicer to install to /usr/share/local/
  * input-surface: Remove unused variable
  * input-surface: Move feedbackd notification to separate function
  * input-surface: Emit feedback on all gtk button presses.
    Otherwise we e.g. don't have feedback when selecting entries
    in the menu or when picking a word completion
  * build: Allow to avoid sm.puri.OSK0.desktop.
    For testing it's convenient to just use phosh's expected filename for
    the OSK. For distros it causes file conflicts
    so allow to use a osk-stub specific desktop filename.
  * input-surface: Don't allow to enable completeion without completer.
    Hide "Enable word completion" button if the completer failed to
    initialize (e.g. because there' no dictionary).
  * completion-bar: Highlight button on press
  * vk-driver: Fix doc string
  * osk-widget: Don't forget to untoggle space in cursor mode.
    When using long press on space to move the cursor make sure we
    reset space to normal state afterwards.
  * input-surface: Remove superfluous return
  * input-surface: Reindent.
    Now that most bits landed, reindent the ui file.
  * virtual-keyboard: Update modifier settings.
    Based on looking what wl_keyboard sends
  * vk-driver: Remove spurious empty line
  * Add a manpage.
    This allows us to have documentation on the system and keeps the
    README size under control
  * debian: Install manpage
  * vk-driver: Allow to submit button presses based on GDK keycodes.
    We can even drop the kernel input-code based bits based on that
    later on.
  * Add a shortcuts-bar widget.
    It reads the shortcuts from gsettings and emits signals when pressed.
    Using GTKs acclerators for that has the upside that we can also easily
    add widgets to configure shortcuts to a settings app.
  * input-surface: Wire up shortcuts bar
  * docs: Mention shortcuts configuration
  * README: Update meson invocation
    `meson setup` is preferred nowadays and while at that ignore the doc
    built to reduce required dependencies and speed up the build even more.
  * osk-widget: Fix typo
  * input-surface: Indentation fixes
  * data: Disable completion by default.
    Fixes: bb4703adc495fe6b82d605df40dd7adaf8ca590b
  * input-surface: Hide completion bar more aggressively.
    We only want it with "regular" language layouts
  * completion-bar: Use all horizontal space.
    This makes completion easier to hit and ensures unchanging
    suggestions stays in place.
  * input-surface: Hide separator when completion option is invisible.
    This avoids having the separator at the bottom of the popover when
    completion isn't enabled at all.

    We already use g_unix_signal_add () so no need to schedule
    this even later.
  * osk-stub: Make loop non-global
  * osk-stub: Always use main loop.
    All invocations already have a running main loop so use that
    instead of exit (0).
  * osk-stub: Use automatic cleanup for GError.
    Rename to `err` to consistency with other error locations in this file
  * osk-stub: Use automatic cleanup for object_path
  * osk-stub: Use automatic cleanup for GVariant
  * osk-stub: Don't create osk_dbus multiple times.
    We don't want a new object when the surface gets recreated
  * osk-dbus: Fix indentation
  * osk-dbus: Log failure when we failt to acquire the well known name
  * osk-dbus: Allow to specify replacement policy.
    So far we always allowed replacement and replaced always, we might
    not always want to do this.
  * osk-dbus: Track whether we have the sm.puri.OSK0 dbus name.
    This allows other parts of the osk to react.
  * osk-stub: Only maintain input surface when we own the DBus name.
    This allows us to easily replace the running keyboard for development
    purposes and makes sure we get back a working one when the replacement
    goes away.
  * data: Allow replacement by default.
    This makes it simple to toy with other implementations without any other
    modificatins.
  * ci: Update build-deps.  This way we don't have to redo the image with
    every new build dependency.
  * ci: Drop Byzantium build.
    It's too cumpersome to keep it up to date, we do that downstream.
  * osk-widget: Parse style.
    This allows us to set style classes.
  * style: Add 'sys' key class.
    This is for non-character keys that are not toggles (e.g. esc, tab)
  * osk-widget: Make backspace 'sys' styled.
    Easier to spot this way.
  * terminal: Use sys class
  * osk-stub: Don't race with wayland registry on startup.
    If we acquire the DBus name before all wayland globals are registered
    we'd hit an assert. Avoid this by just not creating the surface on
    startup, it will happen once all wl globals are there.
  * dir-locals: Fix JS indentation.
    We indent with 2 spaces by default
  * input-methods: Fix doc strings
  * build: Only maintain glib version in a single place
  * layouts: Add more layouts.
    Again taken from gnome-shell as of

  * input-surface: Move adding a layout to an extra function
  * input-surface: Honor POS_TEST_LAYOUT env var.
    This allows to quickly test a layout via
        POS_TEST_LAYOUT=nl POS_DEBUG=force-show _build/src/phosh-osk-stub --replace
    without having to change anything else.
  * input-surface: Emit a warning when we fail to lookup layout info
  * Use less generic name for `config.h`
  * char-popup: Use a grid.
    With lots of chars the single row is hard to use
  * char-popup: Use slightly larger font and more padding.
    This should make the buttons easier to hit.
  * build: Bump glib dependency to 2.66.
    Just to catch up a bit
  * input-surface: Move debug info to separate widget.
    Move the surface that keeps the debug information (which was
    phosh-osk-stub's initial purpose) into a separate widget. This makes
    pos-input-surface focus more in input and also allows us to add new
    things to the debug surface more easily without getting into conflict
    with e.g. the completion code.
    We keep the input-surface's callbacks needed for completion in place.
  * input-surface: Don't leak old_keys
    g_hash_table_get_keys_as_array is transfer: container
  * osk-widget: Handle height requests.
    This allows us to align properly within the input-surface as we're
    no longer dependent on the size of the debug output's box size
  * osk-widget: Make the current mode a property.
    So we can listen for changes
  * osk-widget: Parse locale from layout as well
  * osk-widget: Simplify adding common keys.
    Less code and will allow us to add multiple keys
  * osk-widget: Fix indentation
  * osk-widget: Clearly separate name and display name.
    The name is a unique identifier like `de` or `us` (corresponding to the
    basename of the layout file) while the display name is s.th. like
    `German` or `English (US)`.
  * osk-widget: Move get_popup_pos up
    and drop unused parameters
  * input-surface: Implement GActionMap and GActionGroup.
    This allows us to add actions from other places.
  * readme: Document --replace
  * readme: Use meson consistently.
    This makes it e.g. simpler to pick individual tests, etc.
  * osk-widget: Add key for popover menu

    This allows to select the current layout
  * osk-widget: Center symbols.
    This helps when e.g. the text on the space bar breaks over two lines.
  * osk-widget: Drop '?" from symbol layer toggle.

    When there are no layouts define set the default keymap. Failing to do

    sent a keymap.
  * Clarify 'force-show' debug setting handling.
    Use it to override the GSetting rather than always showing the surface.
    The later was broken and is less useful as we usually want to hide
    the surface without text-input.
    The current interpretation of the option allows us to e.g. to run
    with GSETTINGS_BACKEND=memory easily.
  * data: Remove unused icons
  * build: Fix gettext package name
  * gitignore: Ignore doc package.
    Also drop nonexistent subprojects
  * input-surface: Construct parent object first
  * input-surface: Reduce row spacing on debug page.
    This allows us to fit more information
  * input-surface: Display surrounding text
  * pos-input-method: Fix return argument.
    Return NULL in case of API misuse
  * input-method: Allow to buffer client state.
    If we want to bother about preedit and surrounding-text we need to buffer
    client state and only apply on explicit commit. Add the necessary helpers
    to do that.
  * input-surface: Use actions instead of signals.  This will ease the move to
    a menu later on.

phosh-osk-stub (0.21.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  * vk-driver: Handle CTRL modifier
  * vk-driver: Handle KEY_{COPY,PASTE} as copy/paste keys
  * input-surface: Add copy/paste buttons.
    Let's see how this works out. E.g. it won't work in terminals.
  * ci: Update Debian image
  * osk-widget: Unblur icons.
    I've had these in screenshots and that doesn't look nice.

phosh-osk-stub (0.20.0~beta1) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Sync version number with phosh. This makes sure older phosh-osk-stub
    in the archive doesn't replace us.
  * osk-stub: Use g_autoptr for GError
  * Add input-method.
    Move the wayland bits into a separate object
  * Use input-method instead of open coding
  * Move input-surface to lib.
    This allows us to include it in the documentation and separates
    things more from the binary
  * osk-widget: Add key repeat
  * gitlab-ci: Skip doc build when using PKG_ONLY
  * osk-widget: Cancel current symbol in cursor mode.
    Otherwise we emit a space character when space is released after cursor mode
  * osk-widget: Ignore double click.
  * build: Add generated sources to library dependency.
    Otherwise generated files like the DBus headers might not be around
    when compiling pos-osk-stub.c.
  * pos-input-method: Fix typo
  * pos-input-surface: Notify about screen-keyboard-enabled prop changes.
    The property is G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY.
  * pos-osk-widget: Fix doc string
  * pos-input-surface: Drop (for now) unused prototype
  * pos-input-surface: Add getter for 'surface-visible'
  * pos-input-surface: Add getter for 'screen-keyboard-visible' property
  * pos-input-surface: Handle screen-keyboard-enabled gsetting.
    So far we only adjusted the debug surface string.
  * pos-osk-widget: Split setting of layer to separate function.
    This will allow to trigger it from other parts of the code
  * pos-osk-widget: Rename get_layer to get_keyboard_layer.
    This avoids confusion between the Layer enum and the KeyboardLayer
    struct.
  * pos-osk-widget: Rename get_level to get_layer.
    This makes it match the property and the setter.
  * pos-input-surface: Reset keyboard layer when current osk changes
  * pos-input-surface: Reset keyboard layer to normal on fold.
    This makes sure the user dosn't see "random" levels when e.g. switching
    between apps.
  * data: Indicate that we're using feedbackd.
    This will allow configuration tools to pick up that intent.
  * Recreate input surface when it goes away.
    This can happen when e.g. the output with it is unplugged.
  * osk-widget: Allow to parse PosOskKey.
    Allow to parse the key object rather than just plain strings as we
    do in the current layouts. This allows us to wire up tab, etc in
    layouts.
  * vk-driver: Add function keys
  * Add initial terminal layout.
    This lacks menu key, pos1/end, pg-up/pg-down, esc and control
  * data: Add icon to desktop file

  [ InsanePrawn ]
  * vk-driver: Add keycode for ESC
  * terminal: Add ~, TAB and ESC
